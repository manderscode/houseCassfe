# House Cass-fe - Full-Stack Web Application

This is a full-stack web application where customers are able to enter their coffee order with special instructions and their name. Then, the barista on duty is able to enter their name and their password to sign-in to view customer orders. Once the barista has completed the order, they can click on the check icon and then their completed orders will fall under their name and also under the general category "Completed". The barista can also clear all orders if they want to.
